**Note**: Close is around 9:00.

We build a lot of bouting into our programming, and want to provide more opportunities for fencers who are interested in training hard and competing. At the same time, we will continue to provide development opportunities for fencers who are interested in developing at a more gradual pace, and who are less interested in competition.

The programming structure will rely less on large group instruction. Rather, instruction will primarily take place during individual and small group lessons, which will enable all students to get more focused attention. There will be ample opportunities for skills taught in this manner to be developed through bouting and group footwork classes.

New fencers will be integrated into the regular programming quickly, after a few weeks of group instruction to help get them familiar with the fundamental skills. Please see the section on our new “Introduction to Fencing” program for more information.
