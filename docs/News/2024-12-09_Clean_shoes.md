## Clean shoes for the gym

With winter rapidly approaching, and ground outside being wet, slushy, muddy, sandy and salty, this is a reminder to all members to bring a clean pair of shoes to fencing nights.

### Why?

- Safety: The waxed gym floor becomes very slippery when wet, which makes it dangerous to fence no.
- Respect the facility: The waxing process for the gym floor is expensive and the grit tracked in easily damages the floor.
