## Unexpected cancellation notification procedures

We were asked how a last minute cancellation of a fencing night is handled.

### Primary notification method: E-mail

We will do our best to have a notification sent by e-mail to all registered members by 6:00PM/18:00.

### Secondary methods

We will also post a notification to the following as soon as possible:

- Discord: In the `#announcements` channel.
- Website: On the front page and in the News section.
