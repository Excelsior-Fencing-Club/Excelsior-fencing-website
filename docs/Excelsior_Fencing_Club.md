# About Excelsior Fencing Club

Excelsior Fencing Club was founded over a quarter of a century ago, by a small but determined group of competitive fencers who wanted a place to train. Their hard work and passion for the art of fencing laid the foundation for what Excelsior has become. Through our strong programming, and commitment to developing fencers from the Tri-city area, we earned official affiliation with both the City of Waterloo and the City of Kitchener. Over the last decade Excelsior has evolved into a club, which has focused on community and youth programming.

Excelsior has garnered a reputation for excellence in these areas which resulted in our club being awarded Regional Community Development Centre RCDC status (in association with [a partner club](http://www.westdalefencing.com/) in Hamilton) with the Ontario Fencing Association in 2009. The RCDC status has facilitated strong partnerships in the surrounding area, including outreach programs to several local high schools.
