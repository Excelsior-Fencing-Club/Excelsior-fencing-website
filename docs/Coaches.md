| Jon started fencing in high school and continued with the sport into university where he was on the varsity team for 4 years and weapon captain. When he was finished with school, his travels led him to our K-W location. Jon is certified as an Aide-Moniteur coach in Foil and Sabre. Jon primarily helps with coaching and program development, but can also be persuaded to give private lessons, do high-school demonstrations, referee at tournaments, assist with referee development, and generally fill in the gaps when necessary. Jon's primary weapon is his wit, but he's also known to be pretty handy with a sabre when the fancy takes him. | [![jon](images/coaches/jon.jpg)](images/coaches/jon.jpg) |

| Coach Jake began his fencing journey over 25 years ago at Beaches Sabre Club in Toronto, where he competed in Junior and Cadet events for several years. After settling down in Waterloo many years later, he rejoined the sport at Excelsior as a way to stay active as a new parent and pay forward the positive experiences from his youth. Over the past decade, he has competed, coached, and officiated with the club at various levels in Ontario, sharing his passion and understanding of sabre with everyone along the way. | [![Jacob_Grimshaw.png](images/coaches/Jacob_Grimshaw.png)](images/coaches/Jacob_Grimshaw.png) |
