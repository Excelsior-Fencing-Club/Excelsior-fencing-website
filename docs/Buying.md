## Equipment terms

These are terms you will encounter when looking for equipment.

### Dry

At a high level, fencing without electric scoring equipment is called `dry` fencing (USA) or `steam` fencing (United Kingdom, Australia).

Two judges are positioned behind each fencer, one on each side of the strip. The judges watched the fencer opposite to see if he was hit.

### Electric

The central component of the scoring system is commonly known as "the box". In the simplest version both fencers' weapons are connected to the box via long retractable cables. The box normally carries a set of lights to signal when a touch has been made. (Larger peripheral lights are also often used.) In foil and sabre, because of the need to distinguish on-target hits from off-target ones, special conductive clothing and wires must be worn. This includes a [lamé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lam%C3%A9_(fencing) "Lamé (fencing)"), (a jacket of conducting cloth) for both weapons, a [body cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_cord "Body cord") to connect the weapon to the system, a reel of retractable cable that connects to the scoring box and in the case of sabre, a conducting mask and cuff (manchette) as the head and arms are valid target areas.

### Competition

This is simply having two blades and two body wires as compared to basic electric kit.

This is ensures that you are able to complete even when a piece of equipment breaks.
