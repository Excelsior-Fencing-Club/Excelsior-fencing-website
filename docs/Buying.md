# Buying Equipment

On this page, we identify a few different options for purchasing your own fencing equipment. Note that to keep things simple, we only present a few basic packages here. For a more comprehensive guide to buying equipment, or for specific suggestions, please visit [this link](http://www.westdalefencing.com/shopping-guide/).

We have suggestions for products that either the coaches, or our fencers have found to be satisfactory. We have provided equipment options at different price points, but please note that this is one area where you really do get what you pay for - the cheaper options are great for getting started in the sport, but will need to have components replaced sooner, should you stick with the sport and start to compete. The more expensive options will allow you compete at any competition in Canada. _**We strongly recommend talking with your coach before making any purchases.**_

Please note that we make no guarantees regarding either the vendors, or the equipment here. This page is simply a series of suggestions based on positive experiences that our coaches and fencers have had in the past with both the equipment and the vendors that we hope will be helpful. There are many other options for equipment (many of which will be cheaper than the packages listed here) which you can find by browsing the internet or talking to other fencers / parents.

You will see the label 'FIE' on this page. 'FIE' equipment offers the highest level of protection as it has been tested to much higher standards than non-FIE equipment (an FIE mask is tested to withstand forces in excess of 1600N, whereas a regular mask may only have been tested to withstand 350N, if at all - some of the cheapest equipment has very little testing done on it). Of course, FIE equipment tends to be significantly more expensive. Whether it is worth the extra expense is a personal choice, though in some situations, the coaches will strongly recommend the use of FIE equipment. If in doubt, please talk to one of the coaches. You may like to note that certain competitions (e.g. senior national level competitions) require the use of FIE equipment.
