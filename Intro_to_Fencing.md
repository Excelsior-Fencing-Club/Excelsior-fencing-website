# Intro to Fencing

## Description

This program introduces people to the sport of competitive fencing and teaches fundamental skills, etiquette and provides the foundation necessary to enable you to transition into our other programs.

## Term and commitment

6 week program, after which fencers will transition into the Development program. Fencers may join the program at the start of any month if there is space. Members of our “Intro to Fencing” program will be invited to attend open fencing sessions on other nights once the coaches feel they are ready.

## Cost

See: [General_information -> Schedule of fees](General_information.md#schedule-of-fees)

## Licenses

Associate membership in the Ontario Fencing Association is included in the program fees.

## Equipment

The club provides all equipment for the intro class. Beyond this time, fencers are expected to start to purchase their own equipment (coaches can help with this).

## Expectations

Learn and enjoy fencing. Progress to our [Development and Recreation](Development_and_Recreation.md) program on completion of this program.
