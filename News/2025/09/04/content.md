## Tournament Information

Hi members, 

A new season of competitive fencing is starting up now and we want to make sure you know what to expect if you're thinking of attending tournaments this year. 

### You need a license to participate in tournaments

[https://fencingontario.ca/about-the-ofa/membership-information/](https://fencingontario.ca/about-the-ofa/membership-information/)

This is for insurance and score tracking purposes. There are youth competitive, adult competitive, and recreational. The recreational only works for 4 senior tournaments, all other tournaments require the competitive level. 

Our club code is `XEL`.

### Tournament categorizations

Tournaments are separated by:

- Gender
- Age
- Weapon

As detailed here: [https://fencing.ca/competition-age-categories/](https://fencing.ca/competition-age-categories/)

Lower level tournaments sometimes have different equipment standards. Some youth categories require smaller blade sizes (blade size 5 is the standard adult blade length).

### Tournament schedule

These  tournament schedule for the season is posted here and it details which tournaments are for which age bracket: 

### Costs

The cost varies by tournament, but are typically in the range of 70-150$ per event. 

Registration deadlines are often a week or two before the event itself.

The general flow of a tournament itself is as follows:

1. Check in at the tournament to confirm you are physically present before the posted start time.
   
2. Have your equipment checked at the armoury desk.
   
3. Report to your assigned strip for the first round group stage. All fencers will be placed in groups of 5-7 known as pools and fence everyone in their pool to 5pts. The pool stage typically takes 1.5hrs to complete
   
4. Results from the pool stage are used to rank fencers into a direct elimination tableau.
   
5. Elimination rounds are fenced to 10 or 15pts depending on the age category. Winners advance to the next elimination round; losers are eliminated and no longer fence. Each elimination round takes about 10-15 mins to complete
