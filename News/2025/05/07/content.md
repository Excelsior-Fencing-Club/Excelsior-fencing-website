## CANCELED: Excelsior Fencing Club: SpringFest tournament

Due to low registrations the board of directors and coaches decided it would be best to cancel the Springfest tournament. Thanks to those who showed interest and registered, but given the numbers, it did not make sense to proceed. Refunds will be issued shortly. 

However, we still have the space. So in lieu of the tournament we'll hold an extra practice from 10am-1pm for those interested. People from other clubs are welcome to come free of charge to this special practice. 

Sorry again that we could not make this tournament happen
